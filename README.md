Roadmap
------------

### Initial Release 1.0.0.GA

We have integrated with several products and done extensive load and stress testing.
Also the productive environment with bugzilla http://bugzilla.mimo.ch is now up and running.

### Future releases

We have implemented basic semantic handlers that will aggregate and separate
messages and bodies for the user. We further plan to build a handler that
encapsulates preview handling form a client perspective.

Another future functionality will be the implementation of the RFC draft: "icap-ext-partial-content"
