http://icap.mimo.ch

Roadmap
------------

### Next (Initial Release) 1.0.0.RC1

We are currently finishing the first release. 
Netty ICAP codec is now successfully integration tested with squid 3.1.6
It's not far now and we will release 1.0.0.RC1

### Future releases

We have implemented basic semantic handlers that will aggregate and separate
messages and bodies for the user. We further plan to build a handler that
encapsulates preview handling form a client perspective.

Another future functionality will be the implementation of the RFC draft: "icap-ext-partial-content"
