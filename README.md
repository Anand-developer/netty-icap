ICAP Codec for JBoss Netty
=============

This project enables full ICAP 1.0 Support in combination with JBoss Netty.

Roadmap
------------

### Next (Initial Release)

We are currently finishing the first release. The functionality is there.
In order to provide a robust and sound solution code re-factoring and
negative testing is implemented. Further we Javadoc all necessary details
into the source code.

### Future releases

We have implemented basic semantic handlers that will aggregate and separate
messages and bodies for the user. We further plan to build a handler that
encapsulates preview handling form a client perspective.

Another future functionality will be the implementation of the RFC draft: "icap-ext-partial-content"
